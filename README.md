# esp32-wifi-honeypot
## üìñ Description
This project demonstrates how an **ESP32 module** can be used to simulate a **rogue Wi-Fi access point (honeypot)**.  
The honeypot lures devices into attempting unauthorized connections, allowing monitoring and analysis of suspicious activity.  
Captured traffic is analyzed in **Wireshark on Kali Linux**, mimicking **SOC-level monitoring of wireless threats**.  

This project was created to build awareness about **wireless network vulnerabilities** and show how attackers can exploit insecure Wi-Fi networks.  

## ‚ú® Features
- Simulates a **fake Wi-Fi access point (rogue AP)**.  
- Monitors **unauthorized connection attempts**.  
- Integrates with **Wireshark** for traffic analysis.  
- Provides **SOC-level awareness** of wireless security threats.  
- Demonstrates real-world **red team / blue team learning**.  

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies Used
- **ESP32 module** (for honeypot implementation)  
- **Arduino IDE** (to program the ESP32)  
- **Kali Linux** (for SOC-level monitoring)  
- **Wireshark** (to analyze captured packets)
